## Getting Started

### Installing

Get the latest version of node from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/) or using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).  
Nvm approach is preferred.

Install dependencies by running `npm i`.

Create a *.env.correspondingEnv* (e.g. .env.development) file at the root of the project and add:  
```
REACT_APP_USER_BASE_URL=api_back_url
```  
By default [backend](https://github.com/raparicio6/pokemon-finder-node) uses *http://localhost:8080* as the base url.

To start the server by default (development) run:  
`npm start`

To start a specific environment, run:  
`npm run start-env environment`

#### Only building

To only build the application in a specific env, run:
`npm run build environment`.

### Running the tests

In order to execute the tests run `npm test`.  
[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) was used as the testing framework along with [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/).

### Documentation

Documentation can be seen at `/docs` directory.  
It was generated by `generate-docs.js` script, using [react-docgen](https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen).
